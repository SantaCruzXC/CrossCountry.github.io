			<h3 class="philosophy"> Coaching Philosophy
				<p>
					"I love helping anyone improve their performances at anytime in their lives. I coach appropriate to the age and experience level of the athletes. The best coaching is done on a collaborative level. I do not dictate; I prefer to advise and guide athletes by giving feedback during the journey."
